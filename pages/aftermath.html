<p>The destruction left behind by Harvey was palpable, but Texas spirit and attitude could not have been better demonstrated than by the community-wide effort to save those stranded.  From Rockport to Austin and vicinity, the world witnessed <a href="https://youtu.be/HK6Tt6vXR0E">Texans helping Texans</a>, strangers lending hands to strangers.  Texas rose to the occasion, and it has shown the world how a catastrophy is handled. Our own Houston icon, <a href="https://youtu.be/JzsoJ9RBXEY">Jim McInvale</a>, opened his stores to evacuees turning his locales into shelters, providing warm food, blankets, beds, to help fellow Houstonians in the aftermath of the storm.</p>

<p>People loaded their boats, drove to flooded areas, parked their pickups on side of the road, and went into the flood waters to find and save fellow Texans.  The National Guard was quickly deployed, and Texas took this disaster by the horns.  Texas knows it wonâ€™t be easy, but we will recover.</p>
