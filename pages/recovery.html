<p>Texas knows the recovery will be monumental, but just like Galveston came back stronger and better after Hurricane Ike, Texans know we will comeback stronger and better. </p> 

<p>Texas is already working with FEMA, the National Guard, and other U.S. government agencies to begin the recovery phase of this historic disaster.  FEMA has been actively deployed and victims of this historic flooding are already receiving assistance to rebuild Texas homes.  In Houston, Mayor Sylvester Turner has mobilized the National Guard, State Troopers, the Core of Engineers, and other agencies to identify areas that continue flooding, integrity of our levies, rescue and recovery efforts, and inspection and management of roadways flooded during the storm. </p>

<p>Texans are already tearing off the sheetrock, and thousands of volunteers are coming to Texas from other states to contribute to the recovery effort.  Texas thanks all fellow Americans for their support and commitment to bringing Texas back.</p>
