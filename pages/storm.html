<p>Harvey made landfall near Rockport, a Category 4 hurricane, reaching <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php">winds</a> of about 130mph, causing widespread flooding and damage.  But his assault on the Texas coast was not finished.  A High pressure system northwest of the storm kept Harvey from quickly running his course.  Harvey stalled, took a turn, and headed back on a  southeast trajectory back into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  Harvey was not done yet on his assault on the <a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/tropical-storm-harvey-forecast-texas-louisiana-arkansas">Texas coast</a>.</p>

<p>Harvey regained strength and passed  through the coast of Texas, meandering, sometimes even at speeds of zero miles per hour, stalling, dumping 40 to 52 inches of rain from Matagorda, through Galveston, Beaumont, Houston, San Antonio, and as far inland as Austin and beyond.  Harvey triggered mass flooding throughout these cities, breaking all-time records for a continental U.S. tropical cyclone.</p>

<p>Finally, on August 30th, Harvey left Texas and began to die, but not without causing flash floods in Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and beyond. I heard on the radio that Texas experienced a 40,000-year flood.  This means that the last time it rained like this in Texas, it was during the time of the Neanderthals. </p>
