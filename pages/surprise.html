<p>Tropical Storm Harvey, began his journey to Texas off the coast of western Africa as a tropical wave that meandered slowly into the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea. It was an inconsequential tropical wave, weak, disorganized, and it was not expected to develop into anything other than a bit of rain and eventual dissipation upon crossing the Yucatan Peninsula.</p>

<p>On August 17th, Harvey reached tropical storm status, but as expected, he fizzled out at the Yucatan Penninsula. By August 19th, Harvey hit moderate wind shears, breaking him apart into remnants of a storm.  But little did Texas know that Harvey had other plans up his sleeve.</p>
	
<p>On August 24th, Harvey slowly snuck up on us with a fury! After crossing the Yucatan Penninsula, he regained tropical storm status, and later that day within hours, he became a hurricane, quickly reaching category 3 intensifying to a Category 4 hurricane.  At 3am, on August 25th, Harvey slammed the coast of Texas near Rockport. It was indeed a surprise attack, and Texas was not ready, but Texas fought back.</p>
